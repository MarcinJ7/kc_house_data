kc_house_data - ML project (regression task)

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivachandel/kc-house-data/data

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, namely the kc_house_data, focusing on various aspects of data exploration and regression modeling. The objective was to gain deep insights into the dataset's patterns and relationships, employing regression techniques to predict key variables. The analysis involved preprocessing the data, exploring its statistical properties, and selecting appropriate features for regression. By applying regression algorithms, I aimed to create accurate predictive models that could reveal meaningful trends and patterns within the kc_house_data dataset.
